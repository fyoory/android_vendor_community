# HTC Hero Community vendor tree

This is a vendor tree that allows developers to compile Android 2.0 (eclair)
for HTC Hero devices.  It is based off work by cyanogen, lox, kiall and
jnwhiteh and can be used as a base for custom ROMS.

In order to compile using this source, you must have a 2.x ROM for Hero, along
with the google-ion 1.6 ota image from HTC (currently hardcoded as
signed-google_ion-ota-14721.zip).
